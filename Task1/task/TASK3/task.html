        <p>An angel is a supernatural spiritual being<br>
        who, according to various religions, is God's servant.<br>
        Abrahamic religions often depict angels as benevolent celestial intermediaries between God and humanity.<br>
        Other roles include protectors and guides for humans, and servants of God.A hitman, his lovelorn female partner,<br>
        a quirky young mute, and his endearing father. Mix these discordant characters together <br>
        and filter them through a lens as wide as the grand canyon, and you get 'Fallen Angels',<br>
         a 1995 film from acclaimed Hong Kong director, Wong Kar-Wai. For those unfamiliar with Wai and his filmmaking style,<br>
          his work more easily relates to the breezy, improvisational flow of jazz music than the more rigid and traditional <br<>
          structure of mainstream Hollywood. This approach can be both dazzling and baffling, often at the same time. Responsible for some truly remarkable films, most notably his masterpiece from 2000 'In the Mood for Love', Wai’s approach can be quite divisive amongst filmgoers. Though undoubtedly beautiful, and <br>
          often quite innovative in his visual style, when it comes to story and plot, dependent on your taste, Wai’s films can seem lacking, at least when viewed through the prism of contemporary mainstream plotting. For the most part however, I happen to be a big fan of his style of filmmaking,<br>
           even if the writer in me does occasionally find his lack of focus and cohesion to be frustrating.<br>
           'Fallen Angels' is a strong example of his style, and though it mostly stands up with his best work,<br>
        the film falters slightly where others from Wai,<br>
         like 'Chungking Express' and 'In the Mood for Love', have succeeded.</p>
